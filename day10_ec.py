# Your new company has a list of figures saved in a database. The
# issue is that these numbers have no separator. The numbers are
# saved in a list in the following format:
# [1000000, 2356989, 2354672, 9878098].
# You have been asked to write a code that will convert each of the
# numbers in the list into a string. Your code should then add a
# comma to each number as a thousand separator for
# readability. When you run your code on the above list, your output
# should be:
# [ '1,000,000', '2,356,989', '2,354,672', '9,878,098’]
# Write a function called convert_numbers that will take
# one argument, the list of numbers above.

def convert_numbers(num_list: list):
    new_list=[]
    for number in num_list:
        new_list.append("{:,}".format(number))
    return new_list

numbers = [1000000, 2356989, 2354672, 9878098]
answer = convert_numbers(numbers)
print(answer)
